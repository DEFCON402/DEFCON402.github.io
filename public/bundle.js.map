Our meetings are informal, social and often tend to gravitate toward the technical side of things. That said, we are not afraid of topics like tech policy and we strive to be inclusive rather than exclusive. Many of our members have interesting histories in U.S. government, capture the flag competitions, digital forensics, law enforcement, and various involvement with a small gathering of people in Las Vegas every year known as DEF CON.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 431 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Code of Conduct\",\"layout\":\"page\",\"path\":\"/code-of-conduct/\",\"priority\":1,\"hide\":true,\"body\":\"<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>\\n<h4>PR Code of Conduct</h4>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 432 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Contact Us\",\"layout\":\"page\",\"path\":\"/contact/\",\"iconType\":\"CONTACTUS\",\"priority\":1,\"hide\":true,\"body\":\"<form>\\n  <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n    <label for=\\\"name\\\">Your Name</label>\\n    <input type=\\\"text\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" placeholder=\\\"Enter Name\\\">\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n    <label for=\\\"email\\\">Your Email Address</label>\\n    <input type=\\\"email\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" id=\\\"email\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"emailHelp\\\" placeholder=\\\"Enter email\\\">\\n    <small id=\\\"emailHelp\\\" class=\\\"form-text text-muted\\\">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"form-row\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n      <label for=\\\"inquiry-type\\\">Inquiry Type</label>\\n      <select id=\\\"inquiry-type\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\">\\n        <option selected>General</option>\\n        <option>Slack Invite</option>\\n        <option>Sponsorship</option>\\n        <option>Presentations</option>\\n        <option>Report an Incident</option>\\n      </select>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n    <label for=\\\"message\\\">Your Message</label>\\n    <textarea type=\\\"text\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" rows=\\\"5\\\" id=\\\"message\\\" placeholder=\\\"Message\\\" resizeable></textarea> \\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n    <label for=\\\"captcha\\\">Captcha?</label>\\n    <input type=\\\"text\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" id=\\\"captcha\\\" placeholder=\\\"Possible Captcha\\\">\\n  </div>\\n  <button id=\\\"contact_form_btn\\\" type=\\\"submit\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-primary\\\">Submit</button>\\n</form>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 433 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"navTitle\":\"FAQ\",\"title\":\"Frequently Asked Questions\",\"layout\":\"page\",\"path\":\"/faq/\",\"iconType\":\"FAQ\",\"priority\":2,\"className\":\"faq-viewport\",\"body\":\"<!-- test FAQ, PR the real deal -->\\n<h3>About the group</h3>\\n<p>Q: What is DEFCON?</p>\\n<p>A: DEFCON is the largest security convention in the world.
